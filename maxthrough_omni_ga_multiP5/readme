The main file you want to run to produce the results if you have the locations is maxthrough_deter

-In maxthrough_directional_deter change the parameters in the first few lines (ex: M,N_f,pwr_budget etc.)
-To change parameters of GA change variables in createinput.m file
-Provide the location of the mat file where the su, pu locations are stored
-pu location follow the following format:
	-First M tuples are PU transmitters' coordinates
	-Next M tuples are PU recievers' coordinates
-su location follow the following format:
	-First N tuples are sU transmitters' coordinates
	-Next N tuples are sU recievers' coordinates

-Results:
	- popnum gives the total number of rank 1 solution
	- Use fval(1,1:popnum)./B to get the normalized throughput
	- Use fval(2,1:popnum) to get the number of active users
	- make plots

In order to generate new SU, PU locations which will give a pareto front rather than a single point on the front use maxthrough_generate
